## Year 4 Project Proposal Form

#### SECTION A 
**Project Title:** Automated Detection of Stolen Images

**Student Name:** Thomas Doyle

**Student ID:** 15350316

**Stream:** CASE

**Project Supervisor Name:** 

[Note: It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the Supervisor accepts your project and this is only recognised once the Supervisor assigns herself/himself via the project dashboard. Project proposals without an assigned Supervisor will not be accepted for presentation to the Approval Panel.]

#### SECTION B

### Proposal Description

#### General area covered by the project

This project will cover the area of computer vision and image classification as well as large scale data collection and web scraping.

#### Outline of the proposed project

This project will attempt to scrape a website finding images and cross checking them against a database of known images. It will then give an opinion if this is the true origin of the image or if it has seen the image in another location on the internet with a high confidence of origin.

#### Background

As a photographer it is a fear and something that I have seen very often online. Images are easy to steal and hard to track down. With this automated search tool it will take out the human element of searching for the image origin should you want to buy the image.

#### Achievements

This should be collecting data about images constantly. This will then generate a report of stolen images and alert the origin of these images.
It will also allow a user to find the origin of an image if the project has seen it before.

#### Justification - why/when/where/how it will be useful

This will allow photographer to search if anywhere else is using their images. 
This will also allow a customer to find the real origin of an image to purchase

#### Programming language(s) - List the proposed language(s) to be used

The programming language I will use is python. I feel it has many libraries for computer vision production ready and it is very fast for me personally to write and develop in. Given the short time frame of the project I don't believe I have the time to learn and become comfortable in a new language.

#### Programming tools / Tech stack – e.g. compiler, database, web server, etc.

For my database I am going to choose posgresSQL, apache webserver, imageAI library for python computer vision and most likely make use of Amazon Web Services for the high scaleability. 

#### Learning Challenges - List the main new things (technologies, languages, tools, etc) that you will have to learn

I will have to learn how to design the entire project to scale with a vast amount of data
I will have to learn computer vision
I will have to learn how to apply machine learning to get the confience in predicting stolen images correctly

#### Hardware / software platform - State the hardware and software platform for development

The software will be design to run on linux in the cloud
There is no special hardware for this project

#### Special hardware / software requirements - Describe any special requirements.

#### Make use of figures / diagrams where appropriate.
