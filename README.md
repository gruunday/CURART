# Intro

This project is written in python 3 to attempt to match images and artworks. The purpose of this is to attempt to find people who are using images that are copywright, modified from original or find the source of an artwork. This is implemented using the OpenCV version of the SIFT algorithm. Therefore it is not for comercial use and purely a research project. 

The second aim of the project is to work fast as scale.
